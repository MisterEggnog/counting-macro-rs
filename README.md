# Counting Macros

This library adds macro to get compile time counters.
It uses procedural macros to implement state **between** macro invocations.

## Warning
I'm not certain about the stability or safety of this, so I would not
recomend this for use in serious projects.

Additionally there is currently there is no error handling beyond unwraps.
